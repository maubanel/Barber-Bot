## Mood Boards

I created a collage of various barbershop layouts, styles, and store fronts. I wanted to set the place where Barber Bot could live and function in. Within my collage you can notice I incoporate a lot of white and black with some wood tones. I love the idea of the barbershop having a modern feel and mimicing an luxury experience.

## Bot Inspiration

My bot inspiration comes from a helmet and hair dryer. When I visualzie the product I see someone being able to be comfortable sitting up something and the clipper being able to rotate and complete the haircut. This product will only complete certain types of haircuts such bald, fade, and low cuts.
