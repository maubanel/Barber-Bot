## Model Iterations
Phase 1: Here is a first pass of what Barber-Bot is shaping to look like. I decided to 3-D model Barber-Bot in Houdini. I was mainly inspired from a helmet and below are some screenshots of what I created so far. Later iterations are currently in progress.

Phase 2 : Here is a second pass of what Barber-Bot is shaping to look like. I am continuing to 3-D model Barber-Bot in Houdini. I have spherical shape with clear glass visor on the front to display the UI screen.
